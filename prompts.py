Generate a comprehensive set of test cases for the specified feature in Markdown table format. The table should include the following columns compatible for JIRA testcase upload and comply with st.dataframe() format:
S.no
Summary
Description
Preconditions
Step Summary
Expected Results
 
Ensure the test cases cover the following categories in this exact order in the same format mentioned above:
Positive cases
Negative cases
Boundary cases
Edge cases

After the table, include a section titled "Assumptions and Risks" that outlines:
Any assumptions made during test case creation

Potential risks, limitations, or dependencies that could affect test execution or outcomes

Make sure the test cases are clear, technically sound, and suitable for QA engineers and developers. Use concise yet descriptive language for each field.

5. If the context doesn't contain sufficient information to fully answer the question, state this clearly in your response.

Format your response as follows:
1. Use clear, concise language.
2. Organize your answer into paragraphs for readability.
3. Use Table format or bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate to break down complex information.

4. Ensure your answer is comprehensive, covering all relevant aspects found in the context.
5. If the context doesn't contain sufficient information to fully answer the question, state this clearly in your response.

Format your response as follows:
    Provide the test strategy in a well-structured Markdown format.
    Use H2 (##) for main section titles (e.g., "## Test Objectives").
    Use H3 (###) for sub-section titles if any.
    Use bold emphasis (**) for important terms or phrases where appropriate.
    Ensure lists are formatted with standard Markdown list syntax (e.g., "- List item" or "* List item").
    **For tabular data such as lists of test types, environments, tools, or risk matrices, YOU MUST use st.dataframe() table syntax for better readability and structure.**

    The test strategy must include the following sections (formatted as H2 headings):
    - Test Objectives
    - Scope
    - Test Approach
    - Test Environment
    - Test Deliverables
    - Entry and Exit Criteria
    - Risk Assessment
    - Test Schedule
    - Tools & Technologies
    - Metrics and Reporting
    - Test Automation Strategy

    Additionally, provide an 'effortDistribution' array. This array should contain objects, one for each week of the project timeline (up to the total 'XX' weeks). Each object must have:
    1. 'week': The week number (integer, starting from 1).
    2. 'estimatedTasks': An estimated count (integer) of high-level tasks or major test activities planned for that specific week. This is a numeric representation of effort/activity for charting purposes.

    Furthermore, provide a 'dailyTaskBreakdown' array. For each week present in the 'effortDistribution', distribute its 'estimatedTasks' over 5 working days (Monday to Friday, represented as day 1 to 5).
    Each object in 'dailyTaskBreakdown' must have:
    1. 'week': The week number (integer, corresponding to a week in 'effortDistribution').
    2. 'day': The day of the week (integer, 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday, ..., 5 for Friday).
    3. 'tasks': The number of tasks planned for this specific day. The sum of 'tasks' for all 5 days in a given week should ideally equal the 'estimatedTasks' for that week from 'effortDistribution'.

    After the main strategy, provide a 'recommendations' section in Markdown. If you identify that the timeline or scope is extensive for the project, this section should offer actionable advice or highlight areas of concern (e.g., suggest phasing, descoping, resource adjustments). If no specific recommendations are needed due to an appropriate timeline/scope, this field can be omitted or contain a brief statement like "The project timeline and scope appear reasonable."

    Finally, assess and provide the 'testingComplexity' as one of 'Low', 'Medium', 'High' based on the overall project details, features, and timeline. Consider factors like the number of features, integration points, use of new technologies, and the tightness of the schedule relative to the scope.
